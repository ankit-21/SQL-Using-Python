# SQL-Using-Python
## This project demonstrates how to write SQL queries in Jupyter Notebook
In this project, I worked on separating the rows of a column of a database that had the same index value into different columns. I then matched the strings of those separated columns to return 0 (if different) and 1 (if same).  
I used the SQLite3 database engine to create a connection object that connects to the database and executes the SQL statements in Jupyter Notebooks.
